. User interacts with AI Agent
* AI Agent: “Can I help you?”
* User asks a support question
* ✅ Okta OpenID Connect flow initiated (authenticate user)
    * Agent uses OIDC SPA flow using clientID 0oat46o2xf1bddBxb697
    * Returns id_token + access_token with openid, profile scopes

2. User profile fetch by agent
* AI Agent uses Client Credentials Flow to call Okta /api/v1/users
    * Requires okta.users.read scope
    * ✅ User consent gathered prior
    * Enforces scoped client access, not impersonation yet

3. User requests CRM info on brandon.stark@acme.com
* Agent prepares to access CRM (Salesforce) data
* Since user wants to act on behalf of another user, agent must elevate
✅ PAM + IGA + Just-in-Time Access

    * Agent to use Okta client credentails, ClientID :0oat4agvajRwbJlbU697 and calls Okta PAM secret vault to retreive client secret using /secrets/resource_groups/7b3e9a80-8253-4b42-a4ec-7ddeba77f3da/projects/e9fc2837-32e8-4700-9689-a8d3d3391928/secret/27ab37e0-3fee-442b-8f0f-2cdbd8cfc18e PAM API KeyID: c0e75418-05f5-4c0b-b86a-b4befcbebc25, PAM API keysecret : dTctB7Mg7iYOoeWsOMztuzjcceHhyWoAAstPAQV4fGrM0EWy0Y4vvWjKTXjkGbDMCU1aYiAnpjvrA063f+6Hlg==.
    * IGA request is automatically submitted by Okta based on PAM policy.
    * agent keeps trying and waits for approval
    *  once approved  retreive secret,call the Okta token endpoint using Client Credentials requesting crm.read scope
    * Token contains:
        * scope=crm.read
        * act_as=brandon.stark@acme.com
✅ Key Benefit:
This ensures AI agent doesn’t get access by default — access is explicitly approved and tracked and also time bound only 15 mins.

4. Agent calls Salesforce CRM API ( This is a mock API)
* Uses the access_token with act_as claim
* CRM honors that this action is delegated and restricted

5. User asks AI to update CRM record
* Agent cannot proceed with write access by default
✅ Okta Verify + Dynamic Consent to brandon.stark@acme.com
* Agent sends Okta Verify push to user
    * “Approve AI agent to update Salesforce CRM for Brandon Stark?”
* Once user approves:
    * Agent requests crm.write scope via Client Credentials Flow
    * Scope granted (or gated again via IGA if policy requires)
* Agent performs write to CRM
