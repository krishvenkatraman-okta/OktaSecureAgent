# Okta AI Agent Zero Trust Demo

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application that demonstrates an AI agent implementing Zero Trust security principles using Okta's identity and access management platform. The application showcases a workflow where an AI agent must obtain elevated permissions through Privileged Access Management (PAM), Identity Governance and Administration (IGA), and Just-in-Time (JIT) access controls to access external resources on behalf of users.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Vite for build tooling
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui with Radix UI components and Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: Okta OpenID Connect (OIDC) and OAuth 2.0
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSockets for live updates
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for API state management

### Application Structure
The application follows a monorepo structure with clear separation of concerns:
- `client/` - React frontend application
- `server/` - Express.js backend API
- `shared/` - Shared TypeScript schemas and types

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **React Router**: Using Wouter for lightweight routing
- **Component System**: Modern React with hooks and functional components
- **UI Components**: Comprehensive shadcn/ui component library
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom Okta brand colors
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, React hooks for local state

### Backend Architecture
- **REST API**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time updates for workflow progress
- **Service Layer**: Modular services for different integrations
- **Storage Layer**: Abstracted storage interface with in-memory implementation

### Database Schema
The application uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL, featuring these main tables:
- `workflow_sessions` - Tracks user workflow sessions
- `access_requests` - Manages PAM/IGA access requests
- `token_store` - Stores OAuth tokens and delegation information
- `audit_logs` - Comprehensive audit trail
- `notifications` - System notifications and alerts

## Data Flow

### Workflow Process
1. **User Authentication**: OIDC flow with Okta for initial user authentication
2. **App Membership Check**: Check user access to CRM app using Okta API with userId from ID token 'sub' claim
3. **IGA Access Request**: If denied, submit IGA request with requestTypeId "6871edc88d85367555d34e8a"
4. **Manager Approval**: Wait for approval through Okta IGA system
5. **Access Verification**: Re-check app membership after approval
6. **User Data Request**: User specifies target user email for CRM data access
7. **Push Notification**: Send Okta Verify push to target user (e.g., Brandon.stark)
8. **PAM Credentials**: Retrieve client credentials from PAM with act_as claims
9. **CRM Access**: Access mock Salesforce API with elevated tokens and delegation

### Real-time Updates
- WebSocket connections provide live updates on workflow progress
- Notifications are pushed to the frontend as access requests are processed
- Audit logs are created for all security-relevant events

## External Dependencies

### Okta Integration
- **OpenID Connect**: User authentication with SPA client
- **Client Credentials**: Service-to-service authentication
- **Privileged Access Management**: Secret vault for sensitive credentials
- **Identity Governance**: Access request and approval workflows

### Third-party Services
- **Mock CRM API**: Simulated Salesforce integration for demonstration
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time communication between client and server
- **Neon Database**: PostgreSQL hosting (configured but not required for demo)

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Fast development server and build tool
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the entire application
- **ESLint/Prettier**: Code quality and formatting
- **Drizzle Kit**: Database migrations and schema management

## Deployment Strategy

### Replit Deployment
The application is designed as a full-stack Node.js application that serves both frontend and backend:
- **Server**: Express.js serves the React frontend and provides API endpoints
- **Build Process**: Vite builds frontend, esbuild bundles server
- **Single Port**: Frontend and backend run on the same port with Vite integration

### Environment Configuration
Required environment variables for production deployment:
- `OKTA_DOMAIN`: Okta tenant domain (fcxdemo.okta.com)
- `OKTA_SPA_CLIENT_ID`: Single Page Application client ID
- `OKTA_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS_CLIENT_ID`: Service client ID
- `OKTA_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS_CLIENT_SECRET`: Service client secret
- `OKTA_API_TOKEN`: API token for user management
- `PAM_TEAM_NAME`: PAM team name (defaults to 'fcxdemo')
- `PAM_API_KEY_ID`: Privileged Access Management key ID
- `PAM_API_KEY_SECRET`: PAM secret key
- `PAM_RESOURCE_GROUP_ID`: PAM resource group identifier
- `PAM_PROJECT_ID`: PAM project identifier
- `PAM_SECRET_ID`: PAM secret identifier
- `CUSTOM_DOMAIN`: Custom domain for production (agent.kriyahub.com)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment setting (production for custom domain support)

### Build Process
- Frontend builds with Vite to create optimized React bundle
- Backend compiles with esbuild to single Node.js file
- Express server serves both static assets and API routes
- WebSocket support for real-time workflow updates

### Security Considerations
- Environment variables configured through Replit secrets
- Express server handles authentication and API proxy
- Session management through in-memory storage
- API calls proxied through backend for security
